Debugging with GDB
==================

This chapter will introduce you with the GNU C debugger, aka GDB. When a crash happens, you usually have to find the
guilty part in thousands of lines. You need tools for that, and GDB is the most commonly used debugger under Unix
platforms. Here we'll give you an introduction to GDB and how to practice with it against the PHP source code.

Debug symbols
-------------

GDB requires debug symbols to map the memory addresses in your binary to the original position in your source code. To
generate debug symbols you need to pass the ``--enable-debug`` flag to the ``./configure`` script. To get even more
debugging information you may add the ``CFLAGS="-ggdb3"`` flag which will add support for macros.

Debugging the VM
----------------

The VM lives in the big ``zend_vm_execute.h`` file that is generated by ``zend_vm_gen.php`` from ``zend_vm_def.h``.
Debugging this file can be tedious because it is very large, and it's often not obvious which specialized handler
will run. Luckily, it is possible to debug ``zend_vm_def.h`` directly by generating the VM using the
``php Zend/zend_vm_gen.php --with-lines`` command. This will annotate the code with the ``#line`` preprocessor directive
to allow the debugger to know the origin of the generated instructions.
